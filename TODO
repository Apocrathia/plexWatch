###### DONE 

* code cleanup - merge same routines in sub
    -- added &FriendlyName
    -- still more to do

* alert cleanup - easier to update alert format when needed
   -- $alert_format added to config options
   -- can also override on cli with --format_stop="..." and --format_start="..."
   -- list available format options with --format_options

* cli --watching --watched format can now be edited by the user or specified on the cli

* config options moved into config.pl -- should be easier to upgrade version without having to edit the perl script each time

* config.pl-dist is included --- one must edit and copy it to config.pl


######  Before 0.0.12
* update alert format to be included in --cli options (--watching, --watched). Currently only works for notifcations




######  Long Term

* add more options to --format_options (will probably have to use XML in db going backwards -- maybe even forwards instead of messing with DB table)
  -- XML is not used to pull info for all alerts and to display cli info. This means the above is now possible without too much work (i think)

* merge growl changes from forum - http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php/topic/72552-plexwatch-plex-notify-script-send-push-alerts-on-new-sessions-and-stopped/?p=423033

* display more info --watching. I.E. durations, 'user watching movie  (36 minutes / 120 minutes) anything else useful?

* code cleanup - always available
