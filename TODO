### TODO
# * Add titles to notification -- i.e. pass the notification type (push_watched, push_watching, push_recently_added) to the sub routines 
# * Paused status:  ?? to add ( every run update XML ) -- some DB changes needed too
# * Add GNTP: ?
# * failed,452 status for --watching, --watched ( keep trying notification if failed... set failed and skip after X number of failures or if notification is X old)
#      --- show current time if notification is OLD  'user watching movie  (36 minutes / 120 minutes)' -- requires the pause status update
#      --- this is already true for --recenlty_added ( we need to keep status per provider for --watched,--watching: db changes)
# * rate limiting: provide mechinisms to back off notifications if provider fails (mainly due to --recently_added)
#     -- twitter: DONE 0.0.16
#     -- boxcar: ?
#     -- prowl: ?
#     -- growl: should not have limits
#     -- pushover: ?
#     -- gntp: haven't added GNTP -- but shouldn't have limits


######  Long Term

* add more options to --format_options (will probably have to use XML in db going backwards -- maybe even forwards instead of messing with DB table)
  -- XML is not used to pull info for all alerts and to display cli info. This means the above is now possible without too much work (i think)

* code cleanup - always available

* --watching -- show start time if not at beginning 'user watching movie  (36 minutes / 120 minutes)'

###### DONE  -- cruft -- this is part of the change log

* code cleanup - merge same routines in sub
    -- added &FriendlyName
    -- still more to do

* alert cleanup - easier to update alert format when needed
   -- $alert_format added to config options
   -- can also override on cli with --format_stop="..." and --format_start="..."
   -- list available format options with --format_options

* cli --watching --watched format can now be edited by the user or specified on the cli

* config options moved into config.pl -- should be easier to upgrade version without having to edit the perl script each time

* config.pl-dist is included --- one must edit and copy it to config.pl

* merge growl changes from forum - http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php/topic/72552-plexwatch-plex-notify-script-send-push-alerts-on-new-sessions-and-stopped/?p=423033

* update alert format to be included in --cli options (--watching, --watched). Currently only works for notifications

* display more info --watching. I.E. durations, 'user watching movie  (36 minutes / 120 minutes) anything else useful?
